This program is a guessing game: it "randomly" generates 4 numbers and allows the user to guess the sequence of numbers. Upon making a guess, the program tells the user how many "perfect" and "misplaced matches they got (right number with right location and right number with wrong location respectively).
My team wrote the functions make_guess, which checks the users guess; start_game, which generates the 4 random numbers; and set_seed, which sets the seed for the "random" value.
This is a project I completed for ECE220.
