This program plays "the game of life". Essentially, the game is a state-based game which updates "live" and "dead" cells on a 2D array that is represented by a 1D array. 
If a cell is "alive" and has less than 2 or more than 3 "live" neighbours, it dies. If a cell is "dead" and has exactly 3 "live neighbours", it comes alive. All other cells remain the same.
My team wrote all of updateBoard.c, which contains functions countLiveNeighbour (counts number of "live" neighbour cells on current state), and updateBoard (which modifies the board according to the above conditions)
This was a project I completed for ECE220.
